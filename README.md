## Usage

Since this is a frontend project, you don't need to install requirements on the deployment server.

Install requirements on the developer's machine (or a CI worker) and copy the built files to the deployment server is okay.

**Setup:**

- Install Node.JS (â‰¥12)
- `npm install`

**Development:**

- `npm start`

**Build:**

- `./build.sh`
- Find built files in `build-finished` directory
